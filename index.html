        <h3>Past</h3>
        <p>let's start with my name to formally introduce myself. My name is Jonathan Lancaster but most people call me Johnny. So you're welcome to call me that too. I'm originally from Brazil , born and raised in the land but I possess dual citizenship (American and Brazilian) since my dad is originally from Washington DC. I grew up in the Sao Paulo surroundings most of my childhood playing a lot of sports and learning and using technology. My interest in technology comes from a very young age from the time I got my first video-game console and computer. I used to stay up all night playing video-games, using the computer to learn animation, graphic design, and we can't forget to mention, TRYING to learn how to hack things from the computer. By the age of 18 (about to turn 19) I made my move to Chicago where I lived for three years. Then moved to Los Angeles to pursue one of my aspirations, acting. Well, it turns out that my acting career didn't last long. It wasn't my real passion.</p>

        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>I'm a Jr. Web Developer, but currently working in sales. I've been working in sales and business development for a little over 7 years now. I got plenty of experience internacting and dealing with clients and completing business transactions. Now I'm transitioning into full-time web development. I'm currently finishing an online bootcamp from FreeBootCamp.org. I'm proficient with HTML5, CSS3, WordPress, and Gimp (for graphic designing). I can build responsive websites, write the code and design it.</p>
            
            <p>I'm available to work in projects of any size. Small from creating simple email templates, building landing pages, email signatures, to larger such as building a website responsive with different pages.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>As in everything I do, I plan to become an expert in this field and work as a software engineer helping make an impact in the world with my skills. The sky is the limit, and my capability to learn and improve my skills are limitless.</p>
