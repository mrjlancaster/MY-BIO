        <h3>Past</h3>
        <p>My name is Jonathan Lancaster. I'm originally from Brazil, born and raised but with dual citizenship. My interest in technology comes from a very young age from the time I got my first video-game console and computer. I used to stay up all night playing video-games, using the computer to learn animation, graphic design.</p>

        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>I'm a Jr. Web Developer, before I was working in sales and business development for a little over 7 years. Now I'm transitioning into full-time web development. I'm currently finishing an online Bootcamp from FreeBootCamp.org. I'm proficient with responsive web design, HTML5, CSS3, WordPress, and Gimp (for graphic designing).</p>
            
            <p>I'm available to work on projects of any size. From creating simple email templates to building landing pages to larger responsive and interactive websites.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>As in everything I do, I plan to become an expert in this field and work as a software engineer helping make an impact in the world with my skills. The sky is the limit, and my capability to learn and improve my skills are limitless.</p>
